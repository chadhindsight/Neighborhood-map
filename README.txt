Project 5 - Neighborhood Map
============================
 This is a project that displays a map and information about the landmarks located within. It utilizes The Knockout framework and Googleâ€™s map API. The introduction to Knockout.js has been a bit difficult to absorb, 
but at the end, I have a much stronger confidence I can learn new frameworks and apply them to my javascript knowledge.  
  

 
I finally declared 600px height and 1200px width all of a sudden the map appeared.  I want to note that later when cleaning up my css file, 
I spent a long time trying to figure out the best height/width declarations needed to support a responsive design.  
I finally decided that using vh and vw assignments for my height and width declarations was best. 

HTML, CSS, JS files have been validated. I will note that there is 1 warning in the JS lint saying one function doesn't
always return a value.  Since the marker array is loaded from the model data, I don't feel this is an issue.
